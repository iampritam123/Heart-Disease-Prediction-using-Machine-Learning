# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
In this project, I delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. My goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.

The dataset was taken from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dzz48mvjht/1 and having 12 features
